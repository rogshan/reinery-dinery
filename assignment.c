//double addPoly(double coeff1, coeff2)
//Adds coefficients of each x^n term
//Maybe uses a for loop?????
//Inputs: coefficients of 2 terms
//Output: sum of 2 coefficents
double addPoly(double coeff1, double coeff2)
{
  //I'm not really sure how to code this right now
}

//double subtractPoly(double coeff1, coeff2)
//Subtractss coefficients of each x^n term
//Maybe uses a for loop?????
//Inputs: coefficients of 2 terms
//Output: sum of 2 coefficents
double subtractPoly(double coeff1, double coeff2)

  //I'm not really sure how to code this right now

//double multiplyPoly(polynomial poly, double constant)
//Multiplies each coefficient by a double and returns each
//Inputs: polynomial type, double constant
//Output: polynomial with each coefficient multiplied by a double
